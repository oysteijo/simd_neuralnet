## Testing the optimizers

This directory contains some code that will generate some test data. Run it in
python keras with some optimizer and then store the result (weights) info a file.

The code is more or less only used for internal checking, and will not be built
or run in a normal build process.

### How to run a test.

(Work in progress)
