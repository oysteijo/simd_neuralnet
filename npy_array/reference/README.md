# A reference implementation in python

This directory contains a reference implementation in python.
The functionality of this implementation is supposed to be like
the C implementation, and the API is supposed to be similar.
It should lso be tools to compare this reference to the Keras.

It serves the purpose of prototyping the code and interfaces. It
is also used to check correctness of the C implementation.

### Current state: This needs some cleanup!
